# Observability & Monitoring Stack

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** [2025-10-22]

**Decision**: Adopt Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack for end-to-end observability.

**Context**: End to End Observability improves understanding platform efficient usage, able to measure usage and handle for scaling needs.

**Rationale**: Enables unified monitoring of application health, ML performance, and infrastructure reliability.

**Implementation Details**:
* Log aggregation via Fluentd.
* ML inference metrics exported to Prometheus.
* Alerting rules based on latency, drift, and error thresholds.

**Trade-offs**: Additional maintenance effort but improves visibility and proactive incident response.
