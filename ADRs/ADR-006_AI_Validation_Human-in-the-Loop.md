# AI Validation & Human-in-the-Loop

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** [2025-10-22]

**Decision**: Integrate human oversight into AI workflows for critical use cases like billing, fines, and fraud alerts.

**Context**: Customer disputes and false positives require manual intervention to maintain trust and transparency.

**Rationale**: Enhances accountability and fairness while allowing AI to handle most cases autonomously.

**Implementation Details**:
* Confidence threshold (e.g., <85%) triggers human review.
* Review interface built into the admin dashboard.
* Feedback data used to retrain models.

**Trade-offs**: Slight delay in response time but higher customer satisfaction and trust.
