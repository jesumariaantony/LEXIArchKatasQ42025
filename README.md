# Overview & Problem Statement

## Problem Statement

MobilityCorp needs an AI-driven architecture that dynamically aligns fleet availability, charging logistics, and user demand forecasts to improve service reliability, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency while ensuring scalability across cities.

## Challenges with MobilityCorp

**Customer Experience**:
1. Customers often find the vehicles they need aren’t available where or when they want them.
2. Inconsistent availability discourages regular use.
3. Low Battery (SoC) vehicles and sometimes dead battery

**Operations**:
1. It’s hard to predict when and where vehicles will be needed.
2. Prioritizing battery swaps and rebalancing the fleet is challenging.
   
**Usage & Retention**:
1. Most customers use the service sporadically rather than for regular commutes.
2. Low Customer repeat / Weak conversion
   
**Energy Management**:
1. Vehicles sometimes run low on charge before staff can reach them.

## Current Operations

1. **Cars and Vans**: Can be booked up to 7 days in advance for a set duration.
2. **Bikes and Scooters**: Can be booked 30 minutes ahead and used for up to 12 hours.
3. **Payments**: Charged per minute, with fines for late returns or parking in the wrong spot.
4. **Return Process**: Vehicles must be returned to designated spots. Customers provide photo proof and optional feedback.
5. **Maintenance**: Staff replace batteries for scooters and bikes and redistribute vehicles to ensure availability.

## Opportunities

By using smart data insights and predictive tools, MobilityCorp can:
* Forecast demand to make sure vehicles are in the right place at the right time.
* Optimize maintenance and charging schedules to reduce downtime.
* Summarize and learn from customer feedback to improve service.
* Encourage regular usage by understanding travel habits and offering helpful suggestions.

# Agentic AI Implementation with Multi-Agent System

Integrating a multi-agent, agentic AI approach enhances MobilityCorp’s ability to manage complex operations dynamically, supports real-time adaptive decision-making, and allows the system to scale as new agents are introduced for additional services or geographic locations. MobilityCorp has complex, dynamic operational requirements involving real-time decision making for multiple vehicle types, staff routing, and customer interactions.

Implement an agent-based AI architecture where multiple specialized agents operate collaboratively to manage fleet operations, demand forecasting, battery swaps, and customer engagement.
*Each agent is responsible for a specific domain (e.g., Demand Agent, Battery Agent, Routing Agent, Recommender Agent, Fraud Detection Agent).
*Agents communicate via a message bus (Kafka) and share state through a centralized feature store.
*Decentralized decision-making allows for faster response, robustness, and modular scalability.

**Implementation Details**:

Agent Types:

* **Demand Agent**: Predicts short-term and long-term vehicle demand by location.
* **Battery Agent**: Monitors charge levels, predicts battery depletion, and schedules swaps.
* **Routing Agent**: Computes optimal paths for staff and vehicle redistribution.
* **Recommender Agent**: Suggests personalized trips and promotions to customers.
* **Vision Agent**: Verifies vehicle returns and detects damages.
* **Fraud Agent**: Monitors anomalies in GPS, unlocks, and payments.

  ![Agentic / GenAI Feature](/assets/agentic_ai_view.png "Agentic / GenAI Feature")
  
**Communication**: Agents communicate asynchronously using event streams and publish-subscribe patterns.

**Coordination**: A central orchestrator monitors agent performance, resolves conflicts, and triggers retraining or fallback mechanisms.

**Learning**: Agents can adapt policies via reinforcement learning and continuously improve via feedback from operations and customer interactions.

**Trade-offs**:

* Increased system complexity and need for careful orchestration.
* Requires robust monitoring to detect agent conflicts or miscoordination.
* Higher initial development cost, offset by improved scalability, modularity, and responsiveness.
